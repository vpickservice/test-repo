Boost the way people interact with your website, e-commerce or blog with an easy and intuitive WordPress rating system! 

== Description ==
Improving the user experience (UX) with your website is a top priority for everyone who cares about their online activity, as it promotes familiarity and loyalty with your brand, and enhances visibility of your activity.

Yasr - Yet Another Stars Rating is a powerful way to add SEO-friendly user-generated reviews and testimonials to your website posts, pages and CPC, without affecting its speed. 

= How To use =

= Reviewer Vote =
Once YASR is installed, when you create or update a page or a post, a box (metabox) will be available in the upper right corner where you'll
be able to insert the overall rating. You can either place the overall rating automatically at the beginning or the end of a post (look in "Settings"
-> "Yet Another Stars Rating: Settings"), or wherever you want in the page using the shortcode [yasr_overall_rating] (easily added through the visual editor).

= Visitor Votes =
You can give your users the ability to vote, pasting the shortcode [yasr_visitor_votes] where you want the stars to appear.
Again, this can be placed automatically at the beginning or the end of each post; the option is in "Settings" -> "Yet Another Stars Rating: Settings".
This may not works if you use a caching plugin.

= Multi Set =
Multisets give the opportunity to score different aspects for each review: for example, if you're reviewing a videogame, you can create the aspects "Graphics",
"Gameplay", "Story", etc.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is "Overall Rating"? =
It is the vote given by who writes the review: readers are able to see this vote in read-only mode. Reviewer can vote using the box on the top rigth when writing a new article or post (he or she must have at least the "Author" role). Remember to insert this shortcode **[yasr_overall_rating]** to make it appear where you like. You can choose to make it appear just in a single post/page or in archive pages too (e.g. default Index, category pages, etc).

= What is "Visitor Rating"? =
It is the vote that allows your visitors to vote: just paste this shortcode **[yasr_visitor_votes]** where you want the stars to appear. This may not works if you use a caching plugin.

= What is "Multi Set"? =
It is the feature that makes YASR awesome. Multisets give the opportunity to score different aspects for each review: for example, if you're reviewing a videogame, you can create the aspects "Graphics", "Gameplay", "Story", etc. and give a vote for each one. To create a set, just go in "Settings" -> "Yet Another Stars Rating: Settings" and click on the "Multi Sets" tab. To insert it into a post, just paste the shortcode that YASR will create for you.

This is 2 charts in 1. Infact, this chart shows both the most rated posts/pages or the highest rated posts/pages.

Paste this shortcode to make it appear where you want **[yasr_most_or_highest_rated_posts]**

= What is "Most active users" ? =
When a visitor (logged in or not) rates a post/page, his rating is stored in the database. This chart will show the 10 most active users, displaying the login name if logged in or "Anonymous" otherwise. The shortcode : **[yasr_top_ten_active_users]**
